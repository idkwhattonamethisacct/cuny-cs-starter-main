# Week 2 Session 3 Activities

## Activity 1: Implementing CSS Methods

Practice applying CSS using all three implementation methods

1. Create a new HTML file named "css-methods.html"
2. Add several headings and paragraphs with varied content
3. Apply the following styles using all three methods:
   - Inline CSS: Make one paragraph red and bold
   - Internal CSS: Style all h2 elements with blue color and center alignment
   - External CSS: Create a style.css file with rules for the body (font family, background color) and other elements
4. Compare the results and discuss the advantages/disadvantages of each method
5. Link your external stylesheet to your profile page from Session 1

## Activity 2: CSS Selector Practice

Apply different types of CSS selectors to style a structured HTML document

1. Create a new HTML file named "selectors.html" with the following structure:
   - A header with a title and navigation list
   - An article with headings, paragraphs, and a list
   - A sidebar with links and information
   - A footer with contact information
2. Create an external CSS file and use various selector types to style the page:
   - Use element selectors for basic styling
   - Use class selectors for reusable styles (e.g., .highlight, .sidebar-item)
   - Use ID selectors for unique elements (e.g., #header, #footer)
   - Use combinator selectors to target elements in specific contexts
   - Use pseudo-classes for interactive elements (links, buttons)
3. Experiment with specificity by creating conflicting rules and observing which ones win
4. Test your page in a browser and make adjustments as needed

## Activity 3: Styling Your Profile Page

Apply text and box model properties to enhance your personal profile page

1. Open the profile page you created in Session 1 and the stylesheet you linked in Activity 1
2. Apply the following styles to improve your page:
   - Choose appropriate font families, sizes, and colors for headings and paragraphs
   - Add background colors or images to different sections
   - Apply padding, margins, and borders to create proper spacing
   - Use different display properties for various elements
   - Add hover effects to links and interactive elements
3. Test your page in a browser and make adjustments as needed
4. Compare your styled page with your original unstyled version
