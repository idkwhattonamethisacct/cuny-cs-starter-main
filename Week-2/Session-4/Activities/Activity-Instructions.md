# Week 2 Session 4 Activities

## Activity 1: Flexbox and Grid Layouts

Practice creating responsive layouts using both Flexbox and Grid

1. Create a new HTML file named "layouts.html" with the following sections:
   - A header with a logo and navigation menu (using flexbox)
   - A main content area with a sidebar and content section (using grid)
   - A footer with multiple columns of links (using either flexbox or grid)
2. Style the layout using an external CSS file with:
   - Flexbox for the header navigation
   - CSS Grid for the main content area
   - Media queries to make the layout responsive on smaller screens
3. Test your layout by resizing the browser window
4. Experiment with different flexbox and grid properties to see their effects

## Activity 2: Implementing Positioned Elements

Practice using CSS positioning for common UI components

1. Open the layout page you created in Activity 1
2. Add the following positioned elements:
   - A sticky header that remains at the top when scrolling
   - A "back to top" button fixed at the bottom right corner
   - A dropdown menu in the navigation (appears on hover)
   - A tooltip that appears when hovering over an information icon
3. Use z-index appropriately to manage stacking order
4. Test your components by scrolling the page and interacting with the elements
5. Ensure the positioned elements work well at different screen sizes

## Activity 3: Adding Transitions and Animations

Enhance your layouts with transitions and simple animations

1. Open the layout page with positioned elements from Activity 2
2. Add the following transitions and animations:
   - Smooth hover effects for navigation links and buttons
   - Transform effects for interactive elements (scale, translate, etc.)
   - A simple animation for page elements when they load
   - Transitions for the dropdown menu to appear/disappear smoothly
3. Implement prefers-reduced-motion to respect user preferences
4. Test your animations and make adjustments to ensure they're subtle and purposeful
5. Compare your enhanced page with your original version
